<#  // Script to add predefined network printers to a Win10 PC. Different parts of my office use different printers and they have to be added manually. This helps it suck less.
   // The only lines that will have to be edited to work are the write-host menu items and the network paths to your printers.
  // Could be modified to iterate through a CSV/TXT containing a list of printers if you have a bunch to add
